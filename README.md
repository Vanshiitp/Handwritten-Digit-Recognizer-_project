# Handwritten-Digit-Recognizer-_project

This project demonstrates a Handwritten Digit Recognition System using a deep learning approach. The system is trained on the popular MNIST dataset, which contains grayscale images of digits (0-9).
The project includes the following key components:
1. Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and classification.
2. Built an interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter.
3. Allows users to test the model with custom inputs for better understanding of its functionality.

This project is developed using Python, Deep Learning, Tkinter, and the MNIST dataset. It exemplifies the seamless integration of deep learning techniques with a user-friendly graphical interface, making it an excellent starting point for those interested in digit recognition, neural network implementation, and practical GUI development.
